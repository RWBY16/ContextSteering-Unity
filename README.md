# ContextSteering Unity
A research project regarding "context steering behaviors" for use in games with a practical implemention in the Unity game engine.

## Introduction
Steering behaviors are movement algorithms that determine where an AI agent should be next.
These algorithms use basic information about the AI agent (current position, velocity, direcetion, ...) and the world to make a decision on where to go next.
The steering behavior will calculate a direction vector to adjust the movement of the AI agent.

These simple steeringbehaviors can then be combined
